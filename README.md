Match Em

Match Em is a fun but sometimes frustrating game where all you have to do is find matching items.

You can see information about the game at https://tomsnively.com/html/matchem.html

## History

Match Em was written in Unity around 2015. A Windows, Mac, Linux and WebGL (non-mobile browser) versions are available to download/play at https://tomsnively.com/html/matchem.html.

In 2020, Tom Snively re-wrote Match Em using React for all browsers.
In 2022, Tom Snively moved this to GitHub for the possibility of other open source contributors.

## Browser Version

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, after installing, you can run:

### `set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`
### `yarn start`

This runs the app in the development mode. The set NODE_OPTIONS line may be necessary depending on the node version; there may be something that can be upgraded to avoid needing this.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
